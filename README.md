## App Structure

This App is based on Dumb and Container component where container is responsible for getting data connect to store and pass it to dumb component.

I could have used the ATOMIC pattern with storybook but the APP was small and time was less but I did used it in my other project for reference https://github.com/Krishank/ecommerce-react-example

# TODO's

1. Pipeline and deploy
2. Graph

## Improvement or other approaches

1. Could have used styled component (Had Less time but in my other project I have used it https://github.com/Krishank/ecommerce-react-example/tree/master/src/app/components/atoms)
2. Could have used ATOMIC Pattern (Had Less time but in my other project I have used it https://github.com/Krishank/ecommerce-react-example/tree/master/src/app/components)
3. Could have used storybook for all atoms make a DSL (This is small project so no need of that)
4. Could have used TS as My current project is already using it.
5. I could have used Next JS as its looking more promising but I choose the custom setup used before
